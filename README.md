My Hello World: first attempt at creating git repo

I used git at Efinix, but I think I've forgotten a bunch of the details, 
so this will be a good refresher.

At Lattice, we used subversion (svn) for revision control. 
At Achronix, it was Perforce.
At Altera, it was the awful PVCS, then Perforce.
